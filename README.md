# FastFile

FastFile is a web-based file conversion tool that allows users to convert files between different formats directly in their browser. Built with React and powered by FFmpeg, it provides a simple drag-and-drop interface for uploading files and selecting output formats. The application supports popular formats like MP4, WebM, MP3, PNG, GIF, and many more with customizable quality settings. Users can convert files up to 10MB in size (limited to prevent server overflow) and download the converted results instantly. The entire conversion process happens on the server using FFmpeg, ensuring fast and reliable media processing.

## Future Features

Support for document formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.) and archive files (ZIP, RAR, etc.) is planned for future releases.
